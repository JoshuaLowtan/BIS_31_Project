    <h1>How PHP Is Used in Database Programming</h1>
    <p>
        PHP is often used to interact with databases, especially MySQL. It allows developers to connect to a database,
        retrieve data, insert records, update entries, and delete information through SQL queries.
        A typical example is a login system where PHP checks if the user's credentials match records in the database.

    <p>
        The `mysqli` and `PDO` extensions in PHP provide methods to safely run database queries. For example, using
        `mysqli_connect()` lets PHP access the database, while prepared statements help protect against SQL injection.
        PHP and databases work together in dynamic websites like blogs, forums, and e-commerce stores where information is stored and retrieved frequently.
