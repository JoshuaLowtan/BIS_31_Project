    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming in PHP</h1>
    <p>
        PHP supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows developers to organize code using classes and objects.
        One key feature is **encapsulation**, where variables and functions are grouped inside a class, making code more manageable.
        Another important feature is **inheritance**, where one class can inherit properties and methods from another.
        This reduces repetition and supports code reuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHP also supports **polymorphism**, which allows methods to behave differently depending on the object that calls them.
        Lastly, **abstraction** allows developers to define base classes with basic behavior, which child classes can extend or override.
        Together, these features make PHP more powerful for building larger applications like content management systems (WordPress) or e-commerce platforms.
